Log Data Files
- skip the header
- organize data by "accumulated time"
- pressure "P" is main pressure of cabin
- "O2" is oxygen concentration
- F = feeder %, over 100% because at 100% exactly sometimes the powder is depleted in a U shape (U is the transverse cross-section looking at a layer) so they overfeed it to prevent that(?)
- FL and FR are millimeter positions of the feeders
- Script ideas: 
	x one that just goes through the log data and parses
	- one that goes through the non-deposition one and grabs the print time & total machine times
	- ones that can graph various things vs. time, i.e. feeder positions, pO2, pressure, yeah.
